# ðŸ”¬From Lab Furnace toÂ Code: Predicting Mechanical Properties of Heat-Treated Medium Carbon Steel

## 1. Introduction

This machine learning project builds on the results of my undergraduate thesis, which focused on the **Mechanical Properties Study of Inter-Critical Temperature Treated Medium Carbon Steel at Varying Undercooling**. The goal was to explore how heat treatment temperature and quenching media influence properties like **hardness** and **toughness**, and to use machine learning to simulate and predict these outcomes from a synthetically expanded dataset.


### 1.1 Objective

The objective of this project is to develop a multi-output regression model that predicts two key mechanical propertiesâ€”**Hardness (HV)** and **Toughness (J)**â€”based on:

* Heat treatment temperature
* Quenching medium (water or spent oil)
* Yield strength
* Tensile strength
* Modulus of elasticity

### 1.2 Dataset Description

The dataset was generated by augmenting experimental data from my research thesis using **Gaussian noise** to simulate realistic, repeatable trials. The final dataset contains 1000 rows with features including:

* Temperature (Celsius)
* Media (Water or Spent Oil)
* Yield Strength (MPa)
* Tensile Strength (MPa)
* Modulus of Elasticity (MPa)
* Hardness (HV)
* Toughness (J)

```python
# defining numeric columns
numeric_cols = df.select_dtypes(include=[np.number]).columns.tolist()

# synthetic data expansion process
np.random.seed(42)
synthetic_rows = []
valid_temperatures = [750, 800, 850, 900]

samples_per_temp = int((1000 - df.shape[0]) / len(valid_temperatures))

for temp in valid_temperatures:
    base_rows = df[df['Temperature (Celsius)'] == temp]
    sampled = base_rows.sample(n=samples_per_temp, replace=True)
    for col in numeric_cols:
        std_dev = base_rows[col].std()
        sampled[col] += np.random.normal(0, 0.05 * std_dev, samples_per_temp)
    sampled['Temperature (Celsius)'] = temp
    synthetic_rows.append(sampled)

# Combine with original data
df_synthetic = pd.concat(synthetic_rows, ignore_index=True)
df_clean_expanded = pd.concat([df, df_synthetic], ignore_index=True)

# Display the first few rows to confirm successful expansion
df_clean_expanded.head(10)
```

## 2. Skills and Concepts Demonstrated

* **Python & Pandas**: Data loading, cleaning, and synthetic augmentation
* **Machine Learning (scikit-learn)**: Multi-output regression using Random Forest
* **Data Visualization**: Using Seaborn and Matplotlib to display trends
* **Materials Science Knowledge**: Understanding heat treatment effects on steel
* **Model Evaluation**: RÂ² metrics and scatter plot comparisons
* **Synthetic Data Simulation**: Gaussian noise applied to experimental baselines

## 3. Modeling

To predict both hardness and toughness, I implemented a **MultiOutputRegressor** with a **Random Forest** base. The model was trained on the expanded synthetic dataset. Input features were one-hot encoded for categorical variables and scaled appropriately.

```python
RÂ² for Hardness: 0.9996
RÂ² for Toughness: 0.9942
```


These scores suggest high predictive accuracy and strong generalization.

## 4. Key Findings

### 4.1 Quenching Medium Effects

* Water-quenching at 850Â°C yielded the highest hardness.
* Oil-quenching at 900Â°C produced the highest toughness.

### 4.2 Strengthâ€“Toughness Tradeoff

* A classical tradeoff was observed: higher hardness usually led to lower toughness and vice versa.

### 4.3 Visualization

* Scatter plots of hardness and toughness vs. temperature showed clear trends segmented by media.
* Multi-output regression efficiently captured both response variables.

## 5. Conclusion

This project bridges **materials engineering** and **machine learning**, demonstrating how synthetic data derived from experimental observations can be used to train accurate predictive models. The insights not only align with experimental metallurgical principles but also suggest a framework for **data-driven materials optimization**.

## 6. Recommendations

* Explore the use of deep learning (e.g., neural networks) for even higher fidelity prediction.
* Add microstructure image data (SEM/XRD) for image-based property prediction.
* Deploy a Streamlit app for interactive material property prediction.
